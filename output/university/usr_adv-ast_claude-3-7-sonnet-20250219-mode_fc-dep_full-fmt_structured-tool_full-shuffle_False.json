Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Course availability: CS201 has 25 capacity with 24 enrolled, so there is 1 seat available \u2713\n5.

Schedule conflicts: You're enrolled in CS101, but the schedule doesn't show a conflict \u2713\n7. Upper-division requirement: CS201 is an upper-division course, but you have 45 completed credits, which is less than the required 90 credits \u2717\n\nI'm sorry, but you don't meet all the requirements to enroll in CS201. Specifically, you need at least 90 completed credits to enroll in an upper-division course like CS201, but you currently have only 45 completed credits.\n\nI recommend taking more lower-division courses to accumulate the required credits before attempting to enroll in CS201 again.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

I recommend speaking with your academic advisor about the steps needed to clear your probation status.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your academic record or graduation requirements?",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You have a tuition balance of $1,200 that needs to be paid. The graduation requirement states that your tuition balance must be zero or less to proceed with graduation.\n\nAll other requirements look good:\n- You have completed all required courses for your Computer Science major\n- You have completed 10+ general education courses (GEN101-GEN110)\n- You have completed 180 credits (meeting the minimum requirement)\n- Your GPA is 3.8, which exceeds the minimum 2.0 requirement\n- You are in good academic standing (not on probation)\n- The current date (November 15, 2023) is before the graduation deadline (March 1, 2024)\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot process your graduation application at this time due to the outstanding tuition balance. Once you've cleared your tuition balance of $1,200, please come back and we can submit your graduation application.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today?",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.
